 Game Working
 ===========

- In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). 
- The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. 
- The player can move left, right, up and down. 
- The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.
-  Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. 
- Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
